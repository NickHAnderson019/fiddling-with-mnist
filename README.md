# fiddling-with-mnist
Doing some CNN analysis on the MNIST data set. Hoping to store some useful coding methods in here that I can use for later projects. 

### Run Guide

To create the CNN model, run mnist_cnn_train.ipynb. Alternatively, you can use the pretrained model in the model directory. 

Once you have created a model, you can run the mnist_feature_extraction.ipynb file. This file attempts to take a look under the hood of
the CNN to try understand what features are being extracted per filter, per layer.
